# Truck Sales Time Series Analysis

📊 A time series analysis of truck sales data designed to explore trends, visualize patterns, and apply forecasting techniques to historical truck sales data.

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Truck_sales_Time_Series.ipynb`) that walks through the full analysis — from data loading and preprocessing, to visualization and modeling.

## 🧠 About The Project

This project aims to provide an end-to-end analysis of truck sales over time using time series techniques. It includes:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Summary statistics and visual trends.
- **Time Series Visualization** – Plots of historical truck sales over time.
- **Modeling & Forecasting** – Implementation of one or more forecasting models.
- **Evaluation** – Assessing model performance and forecasting accuracy.

> Note: The core logic and outputs are contained in the Jupyter Notebook.
